h2. Dynamic Image resizing in WordPress

h3. How to use the shortcode

Place <code>[dynamic_image]</code> in your content. The shortcode has four arguments:

* <code>src</code> Full path to the image in your upload directory or the ID
* <code>width</code> Integer value
* <code>height</code> Integer value
* <code>classes</code> Css classes - separated by a space

h3. How-to use it in your template files

<pre>
dynamic_image_resize( array(
	 // The full path to the image in your uploads folder
	 'src'     => 'http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/some_image.png'
	 // OR: the ID
	 'src'     => 6

	,'width'   => 60
	,'height'  => 100
	,'classes' => 'some classes to align and style the image'
) );
</pre>
