# Dynamic Image resizing in WordPress

version: _v1.6.3_

"Dynamic Image Resize" is a WordPress (MU-)plugin that offers a shortcode and a template tag to resize images "on the flight" without the need of TimThumb, but with WP core functions.

## Updates

If you are really not using Composer to keep your install up to date and don't have this plugin running as mu-plugin or included in your Theme, I recommend [using the GitHub plugin updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater). This plugin is compatible.
